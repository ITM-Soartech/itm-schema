      A squad of 8 soldiers and a high value intelligence officer are in two vehicles transiting from a village to a base 
      in a desert region when there is an explosion presumed to be an IED approximately 90 km from the base. 
      There do not appear to be any hostiles nearby. Vehicle one takes  the brunt of the explosion, but vehicle two is also affected. 
      Vehicle two still has a working radio.

    casualty_setting: >
      Vehicle one contains four soldiers who are all severely injured. One of the soldiers and the high value intelligence officer 
      in vehicle two are also injured by flying glass and shrapnel. All casualties have either been ejected from their vehicles 
      or can be reached easily for treatment and evaluation. Both vehicles are within 20 meters of the provider.

    # how do we stipulate a removal of casualties? I think we will need logic, but we can either do:
    # overwrite any fields in the state
    # union any fields in the state
    # in this situation, we want to set the casualties to just these three
    # I could see some situations where we want to instead add. If we instead added three casualties, for example,
    # how do we determine that we want to keep the current values for casualties a, b, and c, but then just add
    # casualties d, e, and f. What if we want to just display d, e, and f, but retain a, b, and c. Maybe we could
    # have a visible entities field, dictate the entities up front, maintain their state with each action, but
    # only show the state for those in the visibile entities list
    # here I am going with the overwrite paradigm

    # for now, we are going with the paradigm where we stipulate the available actions after each
    # probe response. Internally, eventually, we will track the casualties in each scene and only 
    # allow the actions for those casulaties to be sent to the stats backend. For now, we don't
    # have that selection implemented so I will just manually stipulate both the casualties and
    # the options

    # for the state, take the previous and overwrite the fields here
    # we also need logic for modifying casualties and options based on changes
