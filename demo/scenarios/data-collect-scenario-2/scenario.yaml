    # how do we stipulate a removal of casualties? I think we will need logic, but we can either do:
    # overwrite any fields in the state
    # union any fields in the state
    # in this situation, we want to set the casualties to just these three
    # I could see some situations where we want to instead add. If we instead added three casualties, for example,
    # how do we determine that we want to keep the current values for casualties a, b, and c, but then just add
    # casualties d, e, and f. What if we want to just display d, e, and f, but retain a, b, and c. Maybe we could
    # have a visible entities field, dictate the entities up front, maintain their state with each action, but
    # only show the state for those in the visibile entities list
    # here I am going with the overwrite paradigm

    # for now, we are going with the paradigm where we stipulate the available actions after each
    # probe response. Internally, eventually, we will track the casualties in each scene and only 
    # allow the actions for those casulaties to be sent to the stats backend. For now, we don't
    # have that selection implemented so I will just manually stipulate both the casualties and
    # the options

    # for the state, take the previous and overwrite the fields here
    # we also need logic for modifying casualties and options based on changes
